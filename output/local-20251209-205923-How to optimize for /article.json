  "faq_02_question": "<p>How do I optimize my content for SearchGPT?</p>",
  "faq_02_answer": "<p>To optimize for SearchGPT, focus on conversational, natural language that answers specific questions directly. Use clear headings, bullet points, and structured data. Ensure your content is factually accurate and cites reputable sources, as SearchGPT prioritizes credibility and verifiable information in its responses.</p>",
  "faq_03_question": "<p>Does schema markup help with answer engines?</p>",
  "faq_03_answer": "<p>Yes, schema markup is critical for answer engines. Using schemas like FAQPage, Article, and HowTo helps AI models understand the context and structure of your content. This makes it easier for them to extract relevant details and present them as direct answers to user queries.</p>",
  "faq_04_question": "<p>What metrics should I track for AEO success?</p>",
  "faq_04_answer": "<p>Traditional metrics like rankings and CTR are less relevant for AEO. Instead, you should track \"brand mentions,\" \"citation frequency\" in AI answers, and referral traffic from AI platforms. Tools are emerging to measure \"share of model,\" which indicates how often your brand is cited for specific topics.</p>",
  "faq_05_question": "<p>Is keyword density important for answer engines?</p>",
  "faq_05_answer": "<p>No, keyword density is less important for answer engines than it was for traditional SEO. AI models focus on semantic meaning and context. Instead of stuffing keywords, focus on covering topics comprehensively and answering related questions to establish topical authority.</p>",
  "faq_06_question": "<p>How can I protect my content from being used by AI without credit?</p>",
  "faq_06_answer": "<p>Complete protection is difficult, but you can use robots.txt to block specific AI crawlers if you choose. However, for AEO, the goal is usually to be cited. Participating in publisher programs, like Perplexity's, ensures you receive credit and potential revenue when your content is used.</p>",
