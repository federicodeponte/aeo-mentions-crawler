  "Direct_Answer": "Here's how <p>Effective AI content optimization strategies in 2025 move beyond basic keyword insertion to focus on Search Experience Optimization (SXO). Leading teams prioritize governance frameworks that improve relevance scores by 40% <a href=\"#source-1\">according to HubSpot's 2025 report</a>.

  "Intro": "<p>Imagine publishing 50 articles a day but seeing your organic traffic drop by 7% across the board. That's the reality for many teams in 2025 who prioritized volume over value.
