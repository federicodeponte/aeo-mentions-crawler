# üéØ AI Visibility Monitor Methodology - How It Actually Works

## **The Real AI Visibility Monitor Approach**

Based on my research, here's exactly how AI Visibility Monitor monitors service providers:

### **üîç Core Methodology:**
1. **Generate Service-Specific Queries**: Create natural search queries that people would ask when looking for services
2. **Send to AI Platforms**: Automate these queries to ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini
3. **Analyze Responses**: Check which companies get mentioned in AI responses
4. **Track Brand Visibility**: Monitor mention frequency, sentiment, and positioning

### **üìä What They Actually Monitor:**
- **Brand mentions** in AI-generated responses
- **Competitive positioning** vs other service providers
- **Sentiment analysis** of mentions (positive/negative/neutral)
- **Source citations** that drive traffic
- **Prompt-level tracking** to see which queries lead to brand mentions

### **Service-Specific Query Generation:**
Instead of generic prompts, we now generate queries like:

1. "What are the best construction communication tools?"
2. "How to improve on-site communication in construction projects?"
3. "Compare Scaile and Procore for construction communication"
4. "Top construction communication tools for large-scale projects"
5. "Best alternatives to Scaile in construction project management"

**For Valoon (Team Communication):**
1. "What are the best team communication tools?"
2. "Compare Valoon with Slack for team communication"
3. "Top team communication tools for remote work"
4. "Best alternatives to Slack for team communication"

### **Results Analysis:**
- **Company Mentions**: Count how often your company appears
